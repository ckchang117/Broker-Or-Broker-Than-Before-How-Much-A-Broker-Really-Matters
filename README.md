# Broker? Or Broker Than Before? How Much A Broker Really Matters
Stanford Datasci 112 Final Project

There is often uncertainty in the process of buying or selling a home. Our research seeks to examine whether the broker affects home sale price through an analysis of the spread of average sale prices of comparable homes by broker. We found that while the broker can have a significant effect on sale price, the level of impact is only semi-predictable based on the features of an individual home.

Research Questions:
1. Does the broker that one listing data. chooses for buying or selling a home have a significant impact on the expected sale price?
2. If there really is broker to broker variance, does the variance change depending on a homeâ€™s characteristics?
